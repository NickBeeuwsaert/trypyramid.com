                   <h4>22-25 May 2017, Portland, Oregon, USA</h4>
                  <p>Development sprints are a key part of PyCon, and a chance for the contributors to open-source projects to get together face-to-face for up to four days of intensive learning, development and camaraderie. Newbies sit with gurus, go out for lunch and dinner together, and have a great time while advancing their project.</p>
                  <p>PyCon is the largest annual gathering for the community that uses and develops the open-source Python programming language. PyCon is organized by the Python community for the community.</p>
