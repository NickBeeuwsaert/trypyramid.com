description: pyramid_ldap3 provides LDAP authentication services for your Pyramid
  application. It is a fork of the pyramid_ldap package with the goal of eliminating
  the dependency on python-ldap and ldappool, replacing it with a dependency on ldap3,
  which is a pure Python package that supports both Python 2 and Python 3.
