description: <p>Atramhasis is an online SKOS editor. This webapplication enables users
  to create SKOS vocabularies consisting of Concepts and Collections. It tries to
  stay close to the SKOS specification. This makes it suited for different types of
  vocabularies such as simple pick lists, authority files, flat lists and basic to
  relatively complex thesauri. Atramhasis is not suited for managing very large or
  complex thesauri such as the AAT.</p>
